    <h1> Final Project Brief</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>
        <a href="https://www.roomrecess.com/mobile/SayWhat/play.html#:~:text=Say%20What%20is%20a%20crazy,%2C%20adverbs%2C%20and%20much%20more">RoomRecess.com</a>
    
        <p>
            RoomRecess.com is a website that provides varieties of madlib games for kids to play. It provides multiple topics that kids can choose from and they can enter their words. I think the choice of the typography and the sizes are good since they pop out and easy to read for the kids. I also think that it is a good idea for it to have slide and appear interaction for each word as they get typed in. The madlib provides sound effects which will engage the kids more when they play the game.

        <p>
            Mad Takes is a website that provides multiple madlib games for people to play. As well as RoomRecess.com, the website provides different choices of madlib games for people to play. One thing that I thought was interesting was that it makes it much easier for the users to print out the finished product after they create it. However, I think the design aspects of this website are lacking such as poor choice of text styles and very compact paddings and margins.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        
        <p>The project goal for me is to further improve my MadLib project. I wish to make it more interactive such as the two above examples. For example, I could make the story and the illustrations more fun and interactive and add interactive sounds. I also think that Recess.com was successful at having interactive motions within the game, which I plan to incorporate. </p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>

        <p> I want my overall design for the website to have a welcoming and approachable feel to it. I also want a playful text that will go along with the fun illustrations that I will be adding to the project. I think the overall feel should be playful since it is a game and hopefully adding more variety to the illustrations can add to the story the user is creating through the madlib game. I will be keeping the color scheme but adjusting just a little bit with the new illustrations.

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>I definitely plan to add more interactions to the game that will make the website more appealing to the users. The current website looks very flat and 2-dimensional. I plan on adding more interactive design such as popup screen for when the player submits the game. I also plan on adding interactive sounds to make the users more interactive and incorporated while playing the game. 
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>

        <p>The intended experience goal for the users is to allow the users to have a fun interactive game experience. I want to create a madlib game that will have the users smile when they create their own stories. I also want the users to question and guess what the story will be when they are choosing their words.
