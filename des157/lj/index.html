        <p>This website uses a lot of interesting image strategies to draw the users in. It is an interactive website where the user will connect the camera and incorporate the user's image into the game. It is a simple game, where the user uses hands in the camera for the website to read and play rock, paper, scissors with another player. Even though it is a simple game, the websiteâ€™s use of imagery and illustrations make it more intriguing and fun. For example, when you first enter the website, it brings up questions to what the website will be about. The illustration of big leaves, forest, and having a mysterious movement behind the leaves brings out the curiosity in users. When starting the game the leaves unfolds like a gate into the game. It is definitely a new and innovative game using new skills with the images.

        I think this article is useful because it breaks down the website and gives few questions to ask myself such as: When do we show the modal?, How do we show the modal?, What does the modal look like?,What information do we present and collect?. I think this article will be nice to go back and go through each checklist to make sure that I have a good standard website. After reading this article, I have a better understanding of the components of a modal window and what makes a good modal window for the users. For example, escape hatch is a component that I did not think much about before,  but now I have a better understanding of it.

        <p>I think this article provides a good skeleton for a comfortable design of websites. I liked how it provides information on how to approach the web design in certain situations. For example, on how to layout inputs of multiple information, and how adding multiple steps can be helpful. I also like how it breaks down the components of the website such as the dropdown menu, different buttons, texts, etc. It was a clear set of instructions to follow and these design patterns can be seen a lot in everyday websites I visit. I wish it had more information on how to use color to communicate information differently.
